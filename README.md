# Gravity-Simulation

This is a gravity simulator which allows you to edit the values of the celestial objects you place in the environment. To calculate the gravitational force I used this formulae: F = G(m1m2/r^2). Where G represents the gravitational constant.

I also **tried** to implement elastic collision, which is where no energy is lost during the collisions to heat or other forms of waste energy.
The way the planets collide and bounce off each other may not be realistic or be in line with the law of conservation of momentum, but it works as a mvp.

I used this article to help me understand how to implement the collisions: https://seanny1986.wordpress.com/2017/10/01/simulation-of-elastic-collisions-in-python/

To play with this simulation you need to download the zip file and then unzip it and click on the exe. Make sure you keep the main.exe and the data folder in the same folder, otherwise it won't work as the main.exe won't be able to find the dependicies in the data folder

Have fun!
